                <h5>Electrical engineer <span>& Solar System designer</span></h5>
                <p>My name is Jürgen Tjiratjiza Viakondo, I am a high achiever and self-starter who earned a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering (Honours) and has a talent for designing transmission and distribution systems, solar systems, power systems protection, and low- and medium and voltage systems. I am capable of using engineering programs like Revit, AutoCAD, Proteus, MATLAB (Simulink), and ETAP. Flexible, a fantastic team player, and quick to learn new skills in any workplace. I've gained experience in electrical engineering while working as an intern at NORED, where I helped to expand many low- and medium-voltage networks and diagnose malfunctioning transformers and other electrical equipment. Because of this experience, I made the decision to concentrate my design project on a challenge that the business faced. I created a GSM-based remote monitoring system for distribution transformers since NORED had a high risk of premature transformer failure due to improper operating circumstances.</p>

                    <p>I worked as an electrical engineering intern at the NORED Ongwediva branch in 2021. My duties included maintaining and updating the electrical network, carrying several field engineering tests on electrical equipment like transformers and reclosers, and conducting cost analysis for ongoing projects.</p>

                        <p>We had to determine the cause of a three-phase Recloser that was connected to a SWER line that unexpectedly tripped. The team had to use the sectionalizing method for troubleshooting in order to determine whether the transmission line was short circuited. However, with the help of the senior engineers, the line was clear and no issues were found. Since it was determined that the earth fault and phase imbalance testers were what was tripping the system, they were turned off.</p>
